    <h1>Q1.What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>JavaScript was initially created to make "web pages alive"<br />
      The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
      right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
      JavaScript can
    </h2>
    <h1>Q2.What is the use of isNaN function?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>In JavaScript NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". The isNaN() method
      returns true if a value is NaN. The isNaN() method converts the value to a
      number before testing it.
    </h2>
    <h1>Q3.What is negative Infinity?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to
      represent a value that is the lowest available. This means that no other
      number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made
      function or by an arithmetic operation.
    </h2>
    <h1>Q4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for
      Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape
      handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to
      develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was
      1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
    </h2>
    <h1>Q5.What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>Undefi ned means you have created a variable but it does not have a
      value. Undeclared means you do not have that variable at all.
    </h2>
    <h1>Q6.Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h1>
    <div id="box">
      <h1 id="p1">hee</h1>
      <h1 id="p2">hee</h1>
      <h1 id="p3">hee</h1>
      <h1 id="p4">hee</h1>
    </div>

    <h1>Q7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h1>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="10px" cellpadding="20px">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>ViewState</th>
          <th>SessionState</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Maintained at page level only.</td>
        <td>Maintained at session level.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple
          pages.
        </td>
        <td>
          Session state value availability is across all pages available in a
          user session.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.
        </td>
        <td>
          In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available
          to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Information is stored on the client’s end only.</td>
        <td>Information is stored on the server.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.</td>
        <td>
          used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.</td>
        <td>
          SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of
          timeouts.
        </td>

    <h1>Q.8What is === operator?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are
      equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the
      strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to
      be different.
    </h2>

    <h1>Q.9 How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h1>
    <h2>
      => We can change, add or remove any CSS property from an HTML element on
      the occurrence of any event with the help of JavaScript. There are two
      approaches that allow us to achieve this task. <br />

      Approach 1: Changing CSS with the help of the style property:<br />
      Syntax:document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style;<br />
      Approach 2: Changing the class itself – We can use two properties that can
      be used to manipulate the classes. <br />
      Syntax:document.getElementById("id").classList
    </h2>

    <h1>Q10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write
      of a file using javascript. <br />
      <br />
      The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt
      method. This technique reads the full file into memory and stores it in a
      buffer. <br />
      Syntax: fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function ) <br />
      <br />
      The fs.writeFile() function is used to write data to a file in an
      asynchronous manner. If the file already exists, it will be replaced.
      <br />
      Syntax: fs.writeFile( file_name, data, options, callback )
    </h2>

    <h1>Q11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: <br />
      <br />

      for - loops through a block of code a number of times <br />
      for/in - loops through the properties of an object<br />
      for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object<br />
      while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is
      true<br />
      do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition
      is true<br />
    </h2>
    <h1>
      Q12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in
      JavaScript?
    </h1>
    <h2>
      =>To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary
      operator(+) function is used in javascript. parseInt() function returns
      Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number. If a string
      with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned as the
      output. <br />
    </h2>
    <h1>Q13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's
      value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the
      object held by that property is eventually released automatically. <br />
      Syntax: <br />
      delete object.property delete object[property]
    </h2>

    <h1>
      Q14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
    </h1>
    <h2>
      =>JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and
      Prompt box.
    </h2>

    <h1>Q15.What is the use of Void (0)?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>javascript: void(0) means return undefined as a primitive value. We use
      this to prevent any negative effects on a webpage when we insert some
      expression. <br />

      For example, in the case of URL hyperlinks. Hyperlinks open by reloading
      the page when the user clicks on the link. When you need to run some other
      code in such cases, you can use javascript: void(0). Syntax
      <!-- <a href="javascript:console.log('1');">Link</a> -->
    </h2>

    <h1>Q16.How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2>
      =>In JavaScript, we can use window.location object to force a page to load
      another page. We can use the location object to set the URL of a new page.
      <br />
      There are different ways – window.location.href property,
      window.location.assign() and window.location.replace() methods, to set the
      URL of a new page using the location object. <br />
      Syntax window.location.href = "new_url";
    </h2>
    <h1>Q17.hat are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h1>

    <h2>
      =>Inner HTML is slow Inner HTML is slow because when we use the inner HTML
      property in the code it allows us to change using the JavaScript language.
      It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we
      have to parse the content again so that’s why it takes time. <br>
       <b style="color: black ">Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved</b> <br>
       <b style="color: black ">Replacement is done everywhere</b> <br>
       <b style="color: black ">It is not possible to append innerHTML</b> <br>
       <b style="color: black ">Breaks the document</b> <br>

    <script>
      div_tag = document.getElementById("box");
      h1_tag = document.getElementById("p1");
      console.log(h1_tag);

      h2_tag = document.createElement("h2"); //<h2></h2>

      h2_txt = document.createTextNode("This is Heading 2 throught JS"); // This is Heading 2 throught JS
