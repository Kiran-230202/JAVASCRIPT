    <h1>Q1. What is jQuery?</h1>
    <h2>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. <br>
        The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. <br>
        jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. <br>
        jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. <br>
